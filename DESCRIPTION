Package: kwb.db
Version: 0.3.0
Title: Functions supporting data base access
Description: This package contains some useful functions, especially for simplifying data transfer
           between MS Access databases and R. With the functions of this package it is not needed
           any more to open and close a database connection explicitely; this is done 'behind the
           scenes' in the functions. Instead of a database connection the path to the database file
           needs to be passed to the functions as an argument. The main functions are hsGetTable
           and hsPutTable which transfer data from an MS Access database to a data frame in R and
           save data from a data frame in R into a table in an MS Access database, respectively.
           Take care when getting time series data from an MS Access database, see therefore
           hsMdbTimeSeries. Use hsTables to get a list of tables that are available in a database
           and hsFields to get a list of table fields that are contained in a database table.
