Package: kwb.db
Version: 0.3.0.9000
Title: Functions supporting data base access
Description: This package contains some useful functions, especially for 
    simplifying data transfer between MS Access databases and R. With the 
    functions of this package it is not needed any more to open and close a 
    database connection explicitely; this is done 'behind the scenes' in the 
    functions. Instead of a database connection the path to the database file
    needs to be passed to the functions as an argument. The main functions are 
    hsGetTable and hsPutTable which transfer data from an MS Access database to 
    a data frame in R and save data from a data frame in R into a table in an MS 
    Access database, respectively. Take care when getting time series data from 
    an MS Access database, see therefore hsMdbTimeSeries. Use hsTables to get a 
    list of tables that are available in a database and hsFields to get a list 
    of table fields that are contained in a database table.
