Description: This package contains some useful functions, especially for
    simplifying data transfer between MS Access databases and R. With the
    functions of this package it is not needed any more to open and close
    a database connection explicitely; this is done 'behind the scenes' in
    the functions. Instead of a database connection the path to the
    database file needs to be passed to the functions as an argument. The
    main functions are hsGetTable and hsPutTable which transfer data from
    an MS Access database to a data frame in R and save data from a data
    frame in R into a table in an MS Access database, respectively. Take
    care when getting time series data from an MS Access database, see
    therefore hsMdbTimeSeries. Use hsTables to get a list of tables that
    are available in a database and hsFields to get a list of table fields
    that are contained in a database table.
